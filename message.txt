               Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad
               of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is
               brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly
               marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader
               emerges from the shadows. the sinister dark lord stares hard
               at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.

                                     LEIA
                         Lord Vader, I should have known.
                         Only you could be so bold. The
                         Imperial Senate will not sit for
                         this, when they hear you've attacked
                         a diplomatic...

                                     VADER
                         Don't play games with me, Your
                         Highness. You weren't on any mercy
                         mission this time. You passed directly
                         through a restricted system. Several
                         transmissions were beamed to this
                         ship by Rebel spies. I want to know
                         what happened to the plans they sent
                         you.

                                     LEIA
                         I don't know what you're talking
                         about. I'm a member of the Imperial
                         Senate on a diplomatic mission to
                         Alderaan...

                                     VADER
                         You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...
                         and a traitor. Take her away!

               Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering
               hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander
               turns to Vader.llo
